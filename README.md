# Building stuff

I'm using this project to learn [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs) and
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It might turn out in a game or not.

# Roadmap

* ~Floor~ and sky
* Show boxes of different colors on the floor
* Mouse to look around
* Cursor in the center and pointing to boxes prints the color
* Hold click to move boxes, release to drop them
* Include physics engine
* Right click to rotate box
